Contactin	IPR032989	Contactins are cell adhesion molecules that belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and are involved in neural development [1]. They usually consist of six N-terminal Ig domains, four fibronectin type III domains, and a C-terminal glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor to the extracellular part of the cell membrane

FAM83H	cd09188	N-terminal phospholipase D (PLD)-like domain of the protein, Family with sequence similarity 83H (FAM83H) on chromosome 8q24.3, which localizes in the intracellular environment and is associated with vesicles, can be regulated by kinases, and plays important roles during ameloblast differentiation and enamel matrix calcification
Hsp40	cd10747	The C-terminal region of the DnaJ/Hsp40 protein mediates oligomerization and binding to denatured polypeptide substrate. DnaJ/Hsp40 is a widely conserved heat-shock protein. It prevents the aggregation of unfolded substrate and forms a ternary complex with both substrate and DnaK/Hsp70; the N-terminal J-domain of DnaJ/Hsp40 stimulates the ATPase activity of DnaK/Hsp70. 
Hematopoietic lineage cell-specific	IPR028534	Hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein (HS1) is a substrate of antigen receptor-coupled tyrosine kinases and it is expressed only in tissues and cells of hematopoietic origin [1, 2]. Tyrosine phosphorylation of HS1 is important for regulating lymphocyte trafficking [3], neutrophil chemotaxis [4] and growth arrest and apoptosis [5]. HS1 is able to bind to F-actin and can increase the rate of actin assembly mediated by the Arp2/3 complex	actin filament polymerization (GO:0030041)	actin binding (GO:0003779)
IFNAR2	IPR016669	The interferon-alpha/beta receptor 1 family of proteins associates with IFNAR2 to form the type I interferon receptor. Binding of interferons alpha and beta to type I IFNs triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins including JAKs, TYK2, STAT proteins and IFNR alpha- and beta-subunits themselves.	cytokine-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0019221)	interferon receptor activity (GO:0004904)
NFX1	IPR034078	This family of transcription factors is conserved from yeast to human. It is named after human NF-X1, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes 		DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700)
Semaphorin	IPR027231	Semaphorins are a family of cell surface and soluble proteins originally identified as axon guidance factors, but are now recognised to to be involved in a wide range of functions, including neural connectivity, angiogenesis, immunoregulation, and cancer 		semaphorin receptor binding (GO:0030215)
TLR5	IPR027176	Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) participates in the innate immune response to microbial agents. Toll-like receptors are classified into various types, depending on their primary sequence and types of ligands they recognise. TLR5 mediates detection of bacterial flagellins, both from from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [1, 2]. TLR5 signaling acts via MYD88. In MyD88-dependent signaling, ligand binding to TLR triggers sequential recruitment of MyD88, members of IRAK (interleukin-1 receptora ssociated kinase) family and TRAF6, that results in nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and induction of cytokine secretion and production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-8 and TNF-alpha	positive regulation of cytokine production (GO:0001819),MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway (GO:0002755),toll-like receptor 5 signaling pathway (GO:0034146),defense response to bacterium (GO:0042742),innate immune response (GO:0045087),regulation of cytokine secretion (GO:0050707)	transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GO:0004888)	integral component of membrane (GO:0016021)
TLR7	IPR026880	Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is a key component of innate and adaptive immunity. TLRs (Toll-like receptors) control host immune response against pathogens through recognition of molecular patterns specific to microorganisms. TLR7 is a nucleotide-sensing TLR, which is activated by single-stranded RNA, acts via MYD88 and TRAF6, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response	MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway (GO:0002755),immune response (GO:0006955),toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway (GO:0034154),defense response to virus (GO:0051607)	single-stranded RNA binding (GO:0003727),transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GO:0004888)	integral component of membrane (GO:0016021)
